# Accessibility

Accessibility describes an ability of the route (and workers in this route) to deliver messages to the destination.

It's related to [reliability](./Reliability.md), but describes the principal ability to reach the destination rather then fraction of messages which reach the destination.


Worker `B` is **accessible from** worker `A` **via** route `A->B` when:
- a message sent by `A` to `A->B` can be received by `B`

Route `A->B` **leads from** `A` **to** `B` if:
- `B` is accessible from `A` via `A->B`

Workers `A` and `B` are **mutually accessible** if there are routes:
- `A->B` **via** which `B` is **accessible from** `A`
- `B->A` **via** which `A` is **accessible from** `B`

**Notation `A->B` in future implies that `B` is accessible by `A` (route leads from `A` to `B`)**

## Local routes

Local route is a route with a *single* local address, e.g. `[0#A]`

Because all workers define how messages are handled
and whether they are forwarded or not,
**routes with multiple local addresses are not local routes**

For example one local workers can send message to a remote node,
hence all the following addressed in the onward route after it will
be in the context of this remote node.

If there is a worker with address `A`,
it's **always accessible** via local route `[0#A]` by **all local workers**
as long as there are no [additional access control limitations](./Trust.md#access-control)

**All node implementations should implement this behaviour.**

## Forwarder workers

In order to make workers accessible, delivery can be routed
through additional workers.
Such workers route all received messages based on some criteria

**Forwarding is the main instrument for workers accessibility**

Let's say we want `B` to be accessible by `A`

- there is a route `A->F` to a forwarding worker `F`
- there is a route `F->B`

Then `B` can be accessible by `A` via route `A->F` if:
- Worker `F` upon receiving a message sends a message to onward route `F->B`


There are many ways to decide the route `F->B` here

1. It can be a part of the onward route, then `B` is accessible by `A` via `A->F ; F->B`
  Such routing worker is called **route based forwarder**

    **If:**
    - `F` is a route-based forwarder
    - and there is a route `A->F`
    - and there is a route `F->B`

    **Then:**
    - `B` is accessible by `A` via route `A->F ; F->B`

2. If can be a part of the router worker state
  Such worker is called **static forwarder**

    **If:**
    - `Fst` is a static forwarder routing to `Fst->B`
    - and there is a route `A->Fst`

    **Then:**
    - `B` is accessible by `A` via route `A->Fst`

3. It can be calculated from the message metadata
  Such worker is called **metadata forwarder**

### Pipelining forwarding

Forwarder workers can be used to create pipeline routes.

For example

**If:**
- `F1` is a static forwarder routing to `F1->F2`
- and `F2` is a route-based forwarder

**Then:**
- worker `B` is accessible by `A` via `A->F1 ; F2->B`

<img src="./images/pipe.jpg" width="100%">

This combination of workers is called a [routing pipe](./Pipes_Channels.md#pipe)

From the perspective of `A`, routing pipe works the same as a single route-based forwarding worker,
which allows an abstraction to hide `F1->F2` communication

Pipes are widely used in Ockam messaging, more on pipes in [Pipes and Channels](./Pipes_Channels.md)

## Mutual accessibility with return routes

Ockam Routing protocol allows workers to trace return route of a message.

Each time a message is sent by a worker, it may add a return route information.
If the worker is forwarding the message, it may use the return route of the received message
and append some additional information to that.

Messages sent through a route `A->B` will have some return route when received by `B`, call it `trace(A->B)`

If return route `trace(A->B)` leads to `A`, then delivery on route `A->B` is **backtraceable**
Such route `trace(A->B) = B->A` is called a **backtrace** of `A->B`

If delivery on a route `A->B` is backtraceable,
then there is a route `B->A`, which is a backtrace of `A->B`,
hence  `A` and `B` are mutually accessible.

<img src="./images/return_routes.jpg" width="100%">

**NOTE**:

Route tracing and routes being backtraceable is **sufficient** to achieve mutual accessibility
of workers, but **not necessary**

If there is a way to discover return route other than route tracing, a delivery which is backtraceable may be extended or wrapped to inject this route. This extended delivery is now backtraceable.

### Local route backtracing

Since a local route `[0#A]` leads to `A` from any local worker,
then this route is a backtrace for **any local route** used to send messages from `A`

**Local delivery is backtraceable as long as sending worker adds its local address to the return route.**

### Forwarding and backtracing

Backtracing is different for route-based, static and metadata based forwarders.

#### For route-based forwarders.

Let's say we want to send a message from `A` to `B` through forwarding worker `F`
- `F` is accessible to `A` via a local route `[0#F]`
- `F` is accessible to `B` via a local route `[0#F']` (`F` may be different from `F'`)

We have a backtraceable delivery `A->F` and backtraceable delivery `F'->B` with respective
backtrace routes `F->A` and `B->F'`

Then
- if the forwarder `F` receives the message from `A` with return route `F->A`,
  it should forward the message with return route `[0#F'] ; F->A`
- if the forwarder `F` receives the message from `B` with return route `F->B`,
  it should forward the message with return route `[0#F] ; F->B`

This makes worker `A` and `B` mutually accessible via routes `A->F ; F'->B` and backtrace `B->F' ; F->A`

Such forwarding worker is called **proxy worker**

Delivery through a proxy worker is backtraceable

By induction, delivery through multiple proxy workers is also backtraceable


Distributed proxy worker (two workers working together as proxy) is called a [Channel](./Pipes_Channels.md#channel):

#### Backtracing with other types of forwarders

Static forwarders forward to a specific route and usually cannot trace return routes to themselves.

As a general rule, **delivery through static forwarders and pipes is not backtraceable**,
but additional forwarding workers can be used to manipulate routes and build backtraceable delivery
over multiple static forwarders.


Metadata forwarders may trace routes, but it depends on the specific implementation.
