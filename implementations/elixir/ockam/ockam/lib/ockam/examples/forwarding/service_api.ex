  Register current process with `self_address` with a remote forwarding service

  `forwarding_service_route` - a route to forwarding service
  `self_address` - local address of this process, needs to resolve to `self()`, if nil - gets an address from the Ockam.Node.Registry pointing to `self()`
  `timeout` - registration timeout

  Returns:

  {:error, :timeout} - timeout before registration confirmation is received
  {:error, :not_registered_worker} - self_address is nil and current process is not registered in Ockam.Node.Registry
